Magento Architecture
====================

Configuration System
--------------------

* One of Magento's core features is the ability to customize almost anything.
* Configuration is divided up into areas: global (base), frontend, adminhtml, webapi_rest, webapi_soap, and crontab
* Configuration is loaded depending on the area chosen
* Default behavior: global configuration is loaded, then specific area is merged (or loaded) on top of global configuration

Magento includes multiple XML files that cover a multitude of use cases during development. Module configuraton
is located in app/code/Vendor/Module/etc directory and usually contains these files:

1. module.xml - initialization or configuration of a module. contains the sequence element which determines load order
2. config.xml - where default configurations for the module are added
3. di.xml - where the apps dependency injection is configured. Virtual types, plugins, and argument modifications are set here too
4. acl.xml - where ACL nodes are configured and set
5. events.xml - where event observers are declared
6. [AREA]/routes.xml - where any controller routes are initialized
7. adminhtml/system.xml - any new store configuration fields are setup here

A core feature of Magento is that you can override almost any configuration file.
