<h1 align="center">Hello, Developer for Magento 2</h1>
<br />

A [very] opinionated guide for everything right and wrong with Magento 2.

> Consistency through standards, harmony through self-actualization.


Rationale
---------

Understanding and implementing a development methodology across a project in 
software is two-fold as a lead. You have workflows and standards specific to a 
codebase and then those to a project. Although their dependencies on one another 
are mutually exclusive, their patterns couldn't be more different.

After accepting it and stopping fighting it, I chose to move my energy here.

Enjoy.
